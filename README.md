# 4ball-simulation


This program simulates the '4-ball coloration' problem. The problem is described below:

"You play a game with four balls: One ball is red, one is blue, one is green and one is yellow. They are placed in a box. You draw a ball out of the box at random and note its color. Without replacing the first ball, you draw a second ball and then paint it to match the color of the first. Replace both balls, and repeat the process. The game ends when all four balls have become the same color. What is the expected number of turns to finish the game?"

The user is prompted to run n simulations. The program runs the simulation n times and outputs the frequency that each result is obtained and concludes with the answer (expected number of turns to finish).
